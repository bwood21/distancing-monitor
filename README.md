# distancing-monitor


We created this using Google Cloud Platform and it's artifical intelligence capability. We used Google's AutoML vision for training a model. We used data from the Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset) for this purpose. We deployed the model in Google Cloud platform by creating a Virtual Machine. We used OpenCV,a Computer Vision library, which helped us to explore the video and image data. We used YOLOv3, an Object Detection Algorithm (https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet), for identifying people. We used google Storage Buckets for storing for video input and output.
